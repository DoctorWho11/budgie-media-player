Simple Media Player using GTK3.10 written in C

Modern, Lightweight and distraction free media experience.

See http://ikeydoherty.github.io/budgie/ for roadmap and features

Notes
----
You must have xdg-user-dirs installed to currently use Budgie.
This is merely because we use glib special directories to detect
where you keep your music ($HOME/Music, but i18n capable)
